I'm currently learning how to code plugins.
So far, I've been going one simple command at a time, and haven't gotten into complex features.

As of this time, due to my lack of continuity, some commands REQUIRE Permissions 3.1.x.
Everytime you see [worldname], it's optional, but specifies target world to use the command on.
The commands and their corresponding permissions implemented so far are as follows:
    time:
        description: allows setting the time or adding to it
        usage: |
               /time set ## [worldname]        - Set time to ## (0-24000)
               /time add ## [worldname]        - Add ## to current time (0-24000)
               /time day                       - Set time to 0
               /time noon                      - Set time to 6000
               /time dusk                      - Set time to 12000

               /time                           - Display possible '/time' commands
